# Moroku-Demo
By Bennie Botha


Hi Moroku, this app was developed for the iOS coding challenge. I hope this app will show my capabilities as an iOS software engineer and my ability to integrate with your systems.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if there are any questions about the app and my implementation.

notes on the app state
--------
The information given to me was that this should not be a production ready app, and it is not, but it should show that I am a capable iOS software engineer.
No unit testing was included as the app is very small and therefore unit testing would take up more time than it is worth for a demo app.
Please run this on an iPhone X or iPhone X simulator.
The app does not function if the internet connection is down. This can be fixed at a later time.
